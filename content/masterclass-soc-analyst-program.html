							The MasterClass SOC Analyst Program includes two courses and two certifications. We have combined the three-day Certified SOC Analyst (CSA) course with the two-day Certified Threat Intelligence (CTIA) course. Master how to Triage and classify incidents as well as how to coordinate Incident handling and response efforts. While our more technical programs like the Certified Ethical Hacker focus on the tactical Cyber Security elements you commonly see with a threat hunter, or SOC level 2 and 3 roles, our SOC analyst course is a great entry point to establish common definitions across the entire SOC team from entry level analysts to managers.
