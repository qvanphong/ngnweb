					<p>If you are looking for an enterprise grade 2-factor authentication (2FA) or multi-factor
						authentication (MFA) product
						that can secure all commonly used business applications and also provides a wide range of
						authentication methods,
						then you are in the right place.

					</p>
					<p>Deepnet DualShield is a multi-factor authentication system that unifies a variety of
						authentication methods,
						protocols, solutions and user experience in a single platform. In addition to the MFA functions,
						DualShield also
						provides self-service Password Reset, Single Sign-On (SSO), Identity &amp; Access Management
						(IAM) and Adaptive
						Authentication. It is one of the most powerful and flexible multi-factor authentication system
						in the world.

					</p>
					<p>
						Deepnet DualShield can be installed on premises or hosted in a private cloud, which means that
						you will have the total
						control of your own user authentication system, and that you will be able to keep your users’
						identities and credentials
						in a safe place.

					<h6>Unified Authentication Protocols</h6>
					<div class="col-8">
						<p>DualShield supports several authentication protocols that have been used by different types
							of applications, including
							LDAP, RADIUS, SAML, FIDO and OATH.
						</p>
						<ul>
							<li>LDAP: commonly used to provide a directory service for storing user information and to
								verify user credentials,
								i.e. usernames and passwords.
							</li>
							<li>RADIUS: a networking protocol that provides centralized Authentication, Authorization,
								and Accounting (AAA)
								services, commonly used by networking devices such as firewalls and VPN servers.
							</li>
							<li>SAML: an open standard for exchanging authentication and authorization data between
								parties, in particular,
								between an identity provider and a service provider. Commonly used by web &amp; clolud
								applications to provide
								single sign-on (SSO).
							</li>
							<li>FIDO: a set of security specifications for strong authentication including multifactor
								authentication (MFA) and
								public key cryptography (PKI). Commonly used to replace password with device based
								authentication.
							</li>
							<li>OATH: a set of open authentication standards, e.g TOTP (Time-based One-Time Password)
								and HOTP (Event-based
								One-Time Password), which have become the de facto OTP standards supported by many
								multi-factor authentication
								products.
							</li>

						<h6>Unified Authentication Experience</h6>
						<p>Multi-factor authentication requires users to provide multiple credentials in the login
							process. It is inevitably more
							complex and time consuming than password only authentication. Typically, users often need to
							access different types of
							remote resources, services and applications, from various types of devices. For instance,
							you may need to connect to
							your corporate network remotely via VPN from your laptop, and you might also need to access
							your business emails from
							your smart phones. Therefore, the user experience in the multi-factor authentication (MFA)
							process is very important. A
							successful MFA product must provide an excellent user experience in such way that users do
							not see multi-factor
							authentication being inconvenient to use, or even reducing their productivity.
