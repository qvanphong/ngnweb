						CISO is the highest paid job title in cybersecurity. Here at EC-Council MasterClass,
						we’ve developed the most robust and cost-effective training program to help you gain the
						credentials you need to learn the skills you need to lead as an executive in
						cyber-security.
					</p>
					<p>
						Our Executive Management Program combines the industry leading CCISO program with deep
						dives into risk and project management via our Risk Management Approach and Practice and
						Certified Project Manager classes. When you combine the unparalleled in-person training
						you’ll receive in our CCISO class with the ability to study risk and project management
						in depth on your own time via our on-demand video training, you get a wholistic view of
						the role of a CISO and how to align your security expertise with the goals of a company.
					</p>
					<p>
						In addition to the executive management training, our Program includes an annual
						standing invitation to the Global CISO Forum, EC-Council’s executive conference, to
						boost your network; a free OhPhish license that enables you to run a phishing simulation
						to test your company’s user awareness; and a 100-user license of EC-Council’s Certified
						Secure Computer User class to train any of your users who need it!
