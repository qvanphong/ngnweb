							CISO is the highest paid job title in cybersecurity. Here at EC-Council MasterClass,
							we’ve developed the most robust and cost-effective training program to help you gain the
							credentials you need to learn the skills you need to lead as an executive in
							cyber-security.
						</p>
						<p>
							Our Executive Management Program combines the industry leading CCISO program with deep
							dives into risk and project management via our Risk Management Approach and Practice and
							Certified Project Manager classes. When you combine the unparalleled in-person training
							you’ll receive in our CCISO class with the ability to study risk and project management
							in depth on your own time via our on-demand video training, you get a wholistic view of
							the role of a CISO and how to align your security expertise with the goals of a company.
						</p>
						<p>
							In addition to the executive management training, our Program includes an annual
							standing invitation to the Global CISO Forum, EC-Council’s executive conference, to
							boost your network; a free OhPhish license that enables you to run a phishing simulation
							to test your company’s user awareness; and a 100-user license of EC-Council’s Certified
							Secure Computer User class to train any of your users who need it!

						<h5>Knowledge</h5>
						<div class="why-paragraph">
							<p>The Executive Management MasterClass Program includes three courses and the top cyber-security certification on the market.</p>
							<p>
								Students will attend the live EC-Council Certified CISO course with project management and risk management deep dive add-ons to help round out your executive education. There is a trend in the industry for a CISO to have an MBA in order to show expertise and engagement with the business world. If you don’t have the time or money to invest in a new master’s degree, consider our executive management program as an alternative. We make sure to emphasize the importance of aligning security to the business and teach you the business skills you’ll need, but through a cyber-security lens.
